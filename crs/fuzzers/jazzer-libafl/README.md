# Jazzer-LibAFL

A fork of [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL) with Team-Atlanta modifications to
be usable as a substitute for libFuzzer in Jazzer.

Original code import was based on [89342b from LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL/commit/89342b22c2011f455566d1b5516177b9857dd3f2).
