# Deep Research Agent Tools

This repository contains tools designed to be used by action plugins. 
Whenever a new plugin is introduced that could benefit from an existing or new tool, we add it here.

## Tool List (Incomplete)

- [Query Rewriter](./query_rewrite.py): Translates natural language queries into optimized keyword-based queries for web searches.
- [Query Deduplicator](./query_dedup.py): Prevents duplicate searches by checking if new queries are semantically similar to previous ones.
- [Evaluator](./evaluator.py): Evaluates the quality of responses generated by LLMs.
- [Aider](./aider_coder.py): A wrapper for the popular AI coding tool, Aider.

## Token Tracking in Tools

Since the tools themselves can invoke LLMs, 
token usage tracking is essential. 
To monitor token usage throughout the process, 
pass a `TokenTracker` object and manually track tokens. 
See [evaluator.py](./evaluator.py) for a reference implementation.
